# Software Engineering Portfolio
Portfolio for all kinds of software engineering projects. 

- ## React
  - [MyReads](https://github.com/sajal2692/ReactND_MyReads): MyReads is a web app built on React, that allows its users to organise their collection of books into three different shelves.

  - [Readable](https://github.com/sajal2692/ReactND_Readable): Readable is a minimalistic content-comment web app made using React and Redux.

  - [Udacicards](https://github.com/sajal2692/ReactND_UdaciCards): UdaciCards is an iOS app, build with React native, that lets you create flash cards for your Questions and Answers, and arrange them in decks.

I also dabble in Data Science. You can find my portfolio for that [here](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio).
